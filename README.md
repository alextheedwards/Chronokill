# Chronokill

A chronological role based game cyber-security education game.

Developed as our final year project at Queen's University, Belfast. Driven by a desire to help reduce the number of cyber attacks that occur as a result of user error we looked to see how we could educate people in an engaging and interactive manner.

Created using Java Springboot and Next projects, the game is served in the web user, removing the need for the user to download software to run on their own computer.

Recieving feedback from our project champions, fellow students and lecturers enabled us to learn about creating a more refined and intuitive user experience, and one that would be easy for a user to use without needing supervision.

An easily adaptable script leaves room for future developments like adding in other cyber-security risks that we haven't covered.

Within this repository are two projects:

## Next App

*chronokill-next-app*

Creates and serves the front end user interface.

To run open the folder in your editor of choice, then install required dependancies using the following command (npm i), then run the project using (npm run dev)

## Springboot App

*chronokill-spring-app*

This project was created to handle reporting and user accounts, but is no longer an intended feature
